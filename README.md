# About

A very small [Yinglet](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Out-of-Placers) language pack add-on for [Better Than Adventure](https://www.betterthanadventure.net/) `v7.2_01` The pack's current release only changes anything with a "th" into a "z" or "zh." Giving it that special Yinglet charm!

# Install

If you already have BTA installed, it's as simple as dragging the `.zip` into the proper folder. This can be accesed on BTA's main menu screen.

If you need help getting *Better Than Adventure* installed, please follow the instructions on the offical website I linked above. They offer a few different ways to install it, just select the one that works best for you!

### Future plans

I had planned on mixing up some of the other sounds like "d" and "t" Changing "the" into "zhe", "de", or "duh" and so on.
