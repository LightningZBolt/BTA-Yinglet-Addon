# About

This is a tiny language pack add-on for [Better Than Adventure](https://www.betterthanadventure.net/) `v7.2_01` this language pack is built for [Yinglets](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Out-of-Placers) or anyone really. The pack's current release only changes anything with a "th" into a "z" or "zh." Giving it that special Yinglet charm! 

## Install

If you already have BTA installed, it's as simple as dragging the .zip into proper folder. This can be accesed on BTA's main menu screen.

> Note: There is currently a bug on Gitlab's download that does not allow you to add the language pack to your game. I do not currently know why and have opened an issue on it. I will look into this.

### Future plans

I had planned on mixing up some of the other sounds like "d" and "t" Changing "the" into "zhe", "de", or "duh" and so on. This so far is the very first release and I have the source avalivle on Gitlab to freely fork or contribute!
